# CriminalMap

## Introduction
  In this personal project, I'm developing a variation of an A* algorithm. When computing the best route between two points, it takes in account real time crime data in order to suggest the **fastest & safest** route.
  The main reason behind why I'm working on this project is to practice what I have learned at my first year at uni, working with real world data and situations.

## Application flow
  The project is structured in 3 + 1 sequential steps which define the general flow of the application. 
### Data gathering
  The first step of the process is to get all the data is needed:
  #### Geospatial data
  Using **overpass API** it gathers geospatial data from **OpenStreetMap**, which GPS routing is based on.
  #### Crime data
  Via **Web Scrapping** with **Selenium + BeautifulSoup** crime data is retrieved from different sources (extendable):
* SpotCrime: https://spotcrime.com/
* CrimeMapping: https://www.crimemapping.com/
