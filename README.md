# CriminalMap

## Introduction
  In this personal project, I'm developing a variation of an A* algorithm. When computing the best route between two points, it takes in account real time crime data in order to suggest the **fastest & safest** route.
  The main reason behind why I'm working on this project is to practice what I have learned at my first year at uni, working with real world data and situations.
